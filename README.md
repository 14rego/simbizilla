# simbizilla

Simbizilla [will be] the MERN version of a game I created with my cousin many moons ago (then called Unboxabiz). Every technology I used then is out of date, so I'm starting over. I could use the coding practice and we both loved to play it.

## game play

Become the CEO of a start-up commercial corporation and get as rich as possible (or crumble trying).

## backend

-   MongoDB Atlas
-   Mongoose schema
-   Express routing

### config.env

```
MONGOPORT
MONGOURI
MONGOAPP
MONGODBNAME
```

### run

`node --env-file=config.env server`

## frontend

-   React
-   Vite
-   Typescript
-   Redux (just for practice, it's overkill)
-   Tailwind

### run

`npm run dev`
