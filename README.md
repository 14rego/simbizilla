# simbizilla

Simbizilla [will be] the MERN version of a game I created with my cousin many moons ago (then called Unboxabiz). Every technology I used then is out of date, so I'm starting over. I could use the coding practice and we both loved to play it.

## game play

Become the CEO of a start-up commercial corporation and get as rich as possible (or crumble trying).

## backend

  * MongoDB Atlas
  * Mongoose schema
  * Express routing

### config.env

```
MONGOPORT
MONGOURI
MONGOAPP
MONGODBNAME
```

### run

`node --env-file=config.env server`

## frontend

  * React
  * Vite
  * Typescript
  * Maybe Redux (just for practice, not because it's necessary)
  * Tailwind

### run

`npm run dev`
